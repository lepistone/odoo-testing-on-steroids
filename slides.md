# A Jobs Queue for processing tasks asynchronously

<!--
Todo:
Job patterns: 
  Try or delay: try: call() except: call.delay(); 
  Fanout: "batch" job that spawn other jobs
install_in_connector
start server with option load=web,connector and the env variable
job delay
job delay with args
What happens when odoo crashes/stops
transactional properties (rollback, commit)
job failure with traceback

.connector-word-title[Connector]

???

How do we queue in Odoo then?
Connector is an OCA addons.

Used in many addons.
Magento. Prestashop. Various connectors.
But also some which are not connectors, addons that use only the jobs queue.
Example: module to import large CSV files in jobs, chunk by chunk.

Framework to build connectors.
But not limited to connectors.

---
# Queue it!

Dependency on .connector-word[connector]

Install your addon in the connector:

```python
from openerp.addons.connector import connector
connector.install_in_connector()
```

--
Declare a job:

```python
from openerp.addons.connector.queue.job import job

@job
def a_heavy_task(session, model_name, record_id):
    # do an heavy task on record_id of model_name
```

--
Produce a job:

```python
session = ConnectorSession.from_env(self.env)
a_heavy_task.delay(session, 'res.partner', 1)
```

# Properties

---

# Priority

```python
a_task.delay(session, 1, priority=10)
a_task.delay(session, 2, priority=100)
```

???
add a schema?
tell use cases (fanout jobs, import of trees, ...)

---

# ETA

```python
a_task.delay(session, 1, eta=60*60)
a_task.delay(session, 2, eta=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1))
```

???
add a schema?

---

# Retries

```python
a_task.delay(session, 1, max_retries=1)
```
--
# Invoke a retry


```python
try:
    do_operation()
except (socket.gaierror, socket.error, socket.timeout) as err:                                                                                              
    raise RetryableError(                                                                                                                            
        'A network error caused the failure of the job: '
